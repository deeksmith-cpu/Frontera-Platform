# Frontera MVP Testing Guide

## For Test Facilitators

### Before the Session

- Share this guide with the participant at least 24 hours before the session so they can complete the preparation steps
- Schedule a video call (Zoom, Teams, Google Meet) and ask the participant to share their screen
- Ask permission to record the call
- Have the feedback questionnaire ready to share at the end (Section 4 below)
- Remind the participant to complete the preparation steps (Section 1) before the call

### During the Session

**Think-Aloud Protocol:** At the start of the call, ask the participant to narrate their thought process as they work through each task. Say:

> "As you go through the platform, please think out loud — tell me what you're looking at, what you expect to happen, and anything that confuses or surprises you. There are no wrong answers. We're testing the product, not you."

**Facilitator rules:**
- Do not guide, hint, or explain features unless the participant is completely stuck
- If they ask "Am I doing this right?" respond with "What do you think?"
- If they're stuck for more than 90 seconds, note the blocker and suggest they move on
- Take timestamped notes on hesitations, errors, and verbal reactions

## Section 1: Preparation (Complete Before the Session)

**Please read this entire section and complete the steps below before our scheduled call.**

### 1.1 Choose a Company

You'll be using Frontera to develop a product strategy for a real (or realistic) company. Choose one of the following:

- **Your own company** — ideal if you're comfortable sharing strategic information
- **A company you know well** — a previous employer, a client, or a company in your industry
- **A fictional company** — if you'd prefer, invent a company in an industry you understand (e.g. "a mid-sized fintech lender targeting SMEs")

Whichever you choose, you should be able to speak to the company's products, customers, competitors, and strategic challenges.

### 1.2 Gather Supporting Materials

The platform will ask you to upload documents that describe the company's context and performance. Having these ready will make the session smoother and more realistic.

**Useful materials to have (any format — PDF, Word, web links):**

- Annual report or financial summary
- Company strategy document or investor presentation
- Product roadmap or product overview
- Market research or competitive analysis
- Customer research, personas, or survey results
- Press releases or recent news articles about the company

**Don't have these to hand?** That's fine. You have two options:

1. **Use publicly available materials** — most companies publish annual reports, investor decks, and press releases on their websites
2. **Generate example documents using an AI tool** — open ChatGPT or Claude (claude.ai) and ask it to create realistic example documents for your chosen company. For example:
   - *"Write a one-page executive summary of annual results for a mid-sized B2B SaaS company in the healthcare sector with £25m revenue"*
   - *"Create a brief competitive landscape overview for a fintech company competing in SME lending in the UK"*
   - *"Write a product strategy summary for a logistics technology company focused on last-mile delivery"*

   Save each response as a PDF or Word document so you can upload it during the session.

**Aim to have 2-3 documents ready.** One is the minimum — the more context you provide, the more tailored the coaching experience will be.

### 1.3 Set Up Your Environment

- Use a laptop or desktop computer with a modern browser (Chrome, Edge, Safari, or Firefox)
- Have your documents saved somewhere accessible on your computer
- Close other tabs and applications to minimise distractions
- Make sure you can share your screen on the video call

## Section 2: Tasks (Complete During the Session)

**Please work through these tasks in order.** Take your time with each one and think out loud as you go.

### Task 1: Sign Up and Set Up Your Company

Go to the Frontera platform URL (provided separately) and create an account. Once you're in, set up your company using the details for the company you chose in Section 1.

### Task 2: Explore the Dashboard

Once your company is set up, take a look at the dashboard. Familiarise yourself with what's available.

### Task 3: Start the Product Strategy Coach

Open the Product Strategy Development tool and begin working through it. The coach will guide you through several phases.

**During each phase, try to:**
- Read what the coach tells you
- Respond with real information about your company where possible
- Upload the materials you prepared when prompted
- Use any available AI features if you notice them

### Task 4: Continue Through the Strategy Process

Keep working through the phases. Go as far as you can, providing thoughtful responses at each stage.

*If you get stuck at any point, note what confused you and move on to the next section.*

---

## Section 3: Post-Task Interview Questions

*Facilitator: ask these verbally after the participant finishes the tasks. Record responses.*

### Open-Ended (ask first, before any rating scales)

1. Tell me about your experience using the platform today.
2. What stood out to you — positively or negatively?
3. Was there anything you expected to find that wasn't there?
4. Was there a point where you felt unsure what to do next?
5. How would you describe what Frontera does to a colleague?
6. Would you use this for real strategic work? Why or why not?

### Probing Questions (use as follow-ups)

- "You paused at [specific moment] — what were you thinking?"
- "You mentioned [X] — can you tell me more about that?"
- "How did that compare to what you expected?"
