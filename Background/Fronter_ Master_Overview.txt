? Problem Statement
Product Model Transformations Are Failing Enterprises: the Frontera Platform Is Inventing the Future of Strategy and Product Model Coaching

The Problem:
Enterprise companies are under massive pressure to modernise — to move faster, work smarter, and deliver customer-centric, outcome-driven digital products. But transformation after transformation fails to stick. Why?
Because the playbooks are broken.

Big consultancies continue to dominate enterprise transformation — but they are stuck in the past. Their operating model "solutions" are still built in static PowerPoints, delivered through one-off workshops, and based on outdated mental models. These consultancies lack embedded coaching, don’t work in the flow of product delivery, and have no real mechanisms to sustain change.

They talk about being product-led, but they’ve never built products. They promise agility, yet deliver theatre. They introduce abstract frameworks that fail to reach teams on the ground. And they rarely — if ever — equip domain leaders (Product, Engineering, Design, Data) with the tools to lead real change.

The result? Strategy disconnected from execution, executive fatigue and lost market share. Teams are still shipping outputs instead of outcomes. And another round of transformation rebooted every two years — more expensive, and still ineffective.

The Opportunity:
It’s time for a new model — designed by real product leaders, not slide builders.
A model that embeds strategy into practice, that supports teams in real time, and that is driven by experts, powered by AI, , and measured by outcomes.



Introducing the Frontera Product Model Platform — the first enterprise-grade, modular coaching platform built to:
* Digitise and embed product strategy and methods at every level
* Bridge the gap between company vision and day-to-day team delivery
* Support ongoing capability development across roles and domains
* Deliver lasting transformation — not transformation theatre
This is not consultancy.
This is the product model platform of the future, which helps you rewire your organisation from within.





FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
Product Model Transformations Are Failing Enterprises: XLR8’s Frontera Is Inventing the Future of Strategy and Product Model Coaching

?? Headline
XLR8 Launches “Frontera Coaching” — A First-of-Its-Kind AI-Powered Product Coaching Platform to Replace Outdated Consultancy-Led Transformation

?? Subheading
Legacy consultancies are stuck in the past. Frontera Coaching is the future of digital transformation: modular, AI-powered, practitioner-built, and designed to embed product strategy, team development, and outcome-based execution at enterprise scale.

?? Body
[LONDON, UK] – Frontera, a modern product coaching and enablement company, today announced the launch of Frontera Coaching, the world’s first AI-powered, end-to-end product model transformation platform designed to help enterprises design, embed and continually enhance their product operating model and delivery capability— not through slide decks, but through intelligent, embedded learning systems.

For decades, legacy consultancies have charged millions to teach product principles—only to leave companies with slide decks, fleeting workshops, and disconnected models that rarely translate into team behaviour or improved customer outcomes. Executives and teams are left unfulfilled, unable to embed a true product operating model that drives growth and innovation.
In a world that moves at the pace of technology and AI innovation, this approach is broken.

Frontera Coaching changes everything.

Built by real product leaders, not theorists, Frontera Coaching combines the power of globally expert human and digital coaching, fuelled by generative and agentic AI with modular content, and domain-specific enablement to create lasting, enterprise-wide change.

“Big consultancies have had their day. The Frontera Platform is about real change—embedding product thinking, not just talking about it,” said [X], CEO of Frontera. “We’re giving companies the coaching, frameworks, tools, evidence, and support to build world-class product organisations—tailored to their strategy, customers and outcomes”

? What Frontera Coaching Delivers
Frontera is more than a learning tool — it’s a transformation system. It supports enterprise product evolution across four interconnected domains:
1. Company & Product Strategy Agent
Built from product experts, with global expertise, this agent helps executive teams research, frame, and write product strategies that align to vision and value.
2. North Star & OKR Agent
Drawing from and enhancing the best methods to define measurable customer and business outcomes that power strategic flywheels and real business impact.
3. Team Mission, Vision & OKR House Agent
Inspired by leading Product led companies globally, this agent coaches product teams to define meaningful customer missions, align to strategy, and build outcome-first delivey.
4. Competency Framework Agent
Using the latest in product development method and tooling this module enables domain leads to define, train, and evolve capability in Product, Engineering, Design, Data, and Delivery.
Every module is modular, intelligent, and interconnected — forming an end-to-end product operating model from strategy to execution, which you can configure for your enterprise.

?? Customer Example: Aberdeen
Aberdeen, one of the UK’s largest wealth and investment platforms, has adopted Frontera Coaching to replace its static product transformation program. In just months, it launched a new company-level product strategy, defined North Star metrics across verticals, and embedded OKR alignment down to the team level — all using XLR8’s coaching platform.
“Frontera helped us do what the big consultancies never could — translate strategy into action, and outcomes into culture. We now coach capability, not compliance.”
– Chief Product & Technology Officer, Aberdeen

Product Pricing – Frontera Coaching Platform

Prompt
I am looking at options for pricing a new Product Model coaching platform for large Enterprises. The platform is designed to transform and disrupt how Enterprises design, adopt and embed product models. There are significant challenges with how consultancies have promised and failed to support Enterprises in adopting product models and modern digital product development models which learn from more modern technology first companies. 

We are building a platform which will blend human and digital coaching, including: core coaching modules in person, virtually or digital modules, AI based agents for each theme of the product: creating product strategy and vision, defining your companies north star.

Can you form the pricing suggestions by reviewing the writing of Madhavan Ramanujam and his podcast with Lenny?
For additional context. We are selling to Enterprises, who have seen multi million spend with the big consultancies fail to deliver results. They are trying to adopt product models to modernise their digital product capabilities and develop sustainable/ differentiated growth in their field. From a persona perspective we are talking to executive, or executive direct reports who are either accountable for the failed transformations to date, or are taking over and trying to turn it round with fear of another failure, inability to see transformation outcomes delivered, and working within legacy enterprises. What pricing structures would you propose to align product and customer outcomes.

I'll search for information about Madhavan Ramanujam's pricing philosophy and his podcast with Lenny to inform my recommendations for your Product Model coaching platform.

Let me get more specific details about Madhavan's pricing philosophy and frameworks:

Fetched The art and science of pricing | Madhavan Ramanujam (Monetizing Innovation, Simon-Kucher)
lennysnewsletter.com
Based on Madhavan Ramanujam's pricing philosophy from his work with enterprise companies and his frameworks, here are my pricing structure recommendations for your Product Model coaching platform:
Core Pricing Philosophy Alignment
Ramanujam emphasizes that "willingness to pay" conversations should happen "early and often" and that successful pricing is built around customer value perception rather than cost-plus models. Given your target audience's pain points - failed multi-million dollar consultancy investments and fear of repeated failure - your pricing must directly address these concerns.
Recommended Pricing Structures
1. Outcome-Based Pricing with Risk Mitigation
Structure: Success-fee hybrid model
* Base Fee: 30-40% of total value (covers core delivery costs)
* Success Fee: 60-70% tied to measurable transformation outcomes
* Risk Cap: Maximum exposure limited to 12-18 months of executive salaries affected
Rationale: This directly addresses executives' fear of another failed transformation by aligning your success with theirs. The base fee ensures your operational viability while the success component demonstrates confidence in your methodology.
2. Modular Value-Based Pricing
Structure: Tiered engagement levels
* Foundation Tier ($150K-250K): Core coaching modules + digital platform access
* Transformation Tier ($400K-600K): Full coaching + AI agents + custom implementation
* Enterprise Tier ($800K-1.2M): Everything + ongoing support + multi-division rollout
Key Innovation: Each tier includes "failure insurance" - if defined milestones aren't met within 6 months, additional services are provided at no cost.
3. Subscription + Performance Model
Structure: Ongoing engagement with performance multipliers
* Monthly Platform Fee: $25K-50K (covers digital coaching, AI agents, basic support)
* Quarterly Performance Bonus: 0.5-2x monthly fee based on KPI achievement
* Annual Outcome Bonus: Up to 3x total annual fees for breakthrough results
This model works well because Ramanujam advocates for understanding "how many customers you should be talking to" and "when to revisit pricing" - the subscription model allows for continuous value demonstration and pricing optimization.
Key Pricing Tactics Based on Ramanujam's Framework
Segmentation Strategy
* Turnaround Executives: Higher base fees, lower success multipliers (they're more risk-averse)
* Growth-focused Leaders: Lower base fees, higher success multipliers (more willing to bet on outcomes)
* Legacy Enterprise vs. Digital-forward: Different packaging emphasizing cultural change vs. process optimization
Behavioral Pricing Elements
1. Anchoring: Lead with your highest-value "Enterprise Transformation" package
2. Loss Aversion: Frame pricing around "cost of continued failure" vs. "cost of transformation"
3. Social Proof: Include case studies showing ROI multiples in pricing presentations
Bundling Strategy (Leaders, Killers, Fillers)
* Leaders: Core coaching methodology and AI strategy agents
* Killers: Premium support, custom integrations, executive access
* Fillers: Digital modules, peer network access, industry benchmarking
Implementation Recommendations
Initial Pricing Conversations
Start every engagement with willingness-to-pay discovery:
* "What was the total investment in your previous transformation attempt?"
* "What's the annual cost of not having effective product capabilities?"
* "What specific outcomes would make this investment feel obvious?"
Contract Structure
* Phase 1 (3 months): Diagnostic and foundation - fixed fee
* Phase 2 (6-9 months): Implementation - outcome-based pricing kicks in
* Phase 3 (ongoing): Sustainment - subscription model
Success Metrics Alignment
Tie pricing to metrics that matter to executives:
* Time-to-market improvements
* Product revenue growth
* Digital capability maturity scores
* Employee engagement in product roles
* Customer satisfaction improvements
This approach transforms your pricing from a cost conversation into a risk mitigation and value creation discussion, directly addressing the psychological and business concerns of executives who've experienced transformation failures. The modular structure allows you to compete against both boutique consultancies and large firms while differentiating through your unique risk-sharing approach.

Getting Started: Your Strategy Playbook
The 5 sets of strategic choices above affect what you do and don’t do. Obviously, it’s not easy or straightforward to find good answers.  There are many strategy tools (e.g. SWOT analysis or BCG Growth Matrix) that you can use to brainstorm and filter ideas, but where do you start?
Basically, you should start with a rough definition of your winning aspiration, then move on to spend more effort on your where-to-play and how-to-win choices, because they form the heart of your strategy and define where/how you will play to win.  To find and choose the best where-to-play and how-to-win choices, the authors recommend using (a) the strategy logic flow and (b) reverse engineering. These, combined with the 5 strategic choices of the choice cascade, form your strategy playbook.

In a nutshell:
* The strategy logic flow gives you a structured approach to think through your strategy, using 7 questions along 4 key dimensions to analyze your organization’s current realities, and help you to generate strategic ideas/choices.
* The reverse engineering process helps you to choose the options that give you the highest chances of success.
