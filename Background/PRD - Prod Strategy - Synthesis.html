<p><strong>Can you research how the book and strategy process Play to Win advises how to take disparate broad research into Play to Win scenarios?</strong></p><p><strong>🗒️ Answer</strong></p><p>The <strong>Playing to Win</strong> framework by Roger Martin and A.G. Lafley transforms broad research into actionable strategy through a cascading set of five integrated choices [<a href="https://www.annashipman.co.uk/jfdi/playing-to-win.html">3</a>] [<a href="https://michaelgoitein.com/the-playing-to-win-framework-a-global-strategy-experts-proven-method/">4</a>]:</p><ol><li><strong>Winning Aspiration</strong> — Define what winning looks like (for Frontera: becoming the leading enterprise platform for UK wealth management firms)</li><li><strong>Where to Play</strong> — Narrow broad market research into specific choices: which customer segments, geographies, channels, and product categories [<a href="https://www.annashipman.co.uk/jfdi/playing-to-win.html">3</a>]</li><li><strong>How to Win</strong> — Identify your competitive advantage in chosen spaces (cost leadership or differentiation)</li><li><strong>Capabilities Required</strong> — Determine what activities and competencies must exist to execute</li><li><strong>Management Systems</strong> — Design systems to support and measure the strategy</li></ol><p><strong>Applying to Frontera:</strong> Take your disparate research on UK wealth management firms and filter it through "Where to Play" choices first — which firm sizes, which specific pain points (compliance, client reporting, portfolio management), which buyer personas. Then assess "How to Win" against competitors like Intelliflo or SS&amp;C. The framework forces you to make explicit trade-offs rather than trying to be everything to everyone [<a href="https://www.tangramstrategies.co.uk/news-and-insight/book-review-playing-to-win">5</a>].</p><p><strong>Sources</strong></p><ol><li><a href="https://fs.blog/playing-to-win-how-strategy-really-works/">fs.blog - Playing to Win: How Strategy Really Works</a></li><li><a href="https://rogermartin.medium.com/four-years-of-playing-to-win-strategy-dc535451a5e7">rogermartin.medium.com - Four Years of Playing to Win Strategy</a></li><li><a href="https://www.annashipman.co.uk/jfdi/playing-to-win.html">annashipman.co.uk - Playing to win</a></li><li><a href="https://michaelgoitein.com/the-playing-to-win-framework-a-global-strategy-experts-proven-method/">michaelgoitein.com - The "Playing to Win" Framework — A Global Strategy...</a></li><li><a href="https://www.tangramstrategies.co.uk/news-and-insight/book-review-playing-to-win">tangramstrategies.co.uk - Book review: Playing to Win - Tangram</a></li><li><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/andrewconstable-mba_most-strategy-frameworks-are-just-fancy-ways-activity-7387377486260547584-16ij">linkedin.com - How to Play to Win with Roger Martin's 5-Question...</a></li></ol><p>Based on your Frontera documentation, here's how to integrate Playing to Win more effectively:</p><p><strong>1. Connect Research Pillars to PTW Choices</strong> Your three research pillars (Macro Market Forces, Customer Research, Colleague Research) should directly feed the PTW cascade:</p><ul><li><strong>Macro + Customer</strong> → Informs "Where to Play" choices</li><li><strong>Customer + Colleague</strong> → Validates "How to Win" options</li><li><strong>Macro + Colleague</strong> → Assesses organizational readiness for capabilities</li></ul><p><strong>2. Strategic Bets as PTW Hypotheses</strong> Your existing Strategic Bets format ("We believe... Which means... So we will explore...") should explicitly map to:</p><ul><li>Where to Play (market/segment choice)</li><li>How to Win (competitive advantage)</li><li>Capabilities required</li></ul><p><strong>3. Synthesis Engine Enhancement</strong> The Cross-Pillar Synthesis should generate 3-5 complete PTW cascades as outputs, not just opportunity maps—each with testable assumptions per Roger Martin's "What Would Have to Be True" methodology.</p><p><strong>4. Agent Coaching Integration</strong> The Product Strategy Agent should guide users through reverse-engineering: starting with aspirations, then stress-testing Where to Play and How to Win choices against research evidence.</p><p><strong>🌐 Sources</strong></p><ol><li><a href="https://techtiff.substack.com/p/claude-cowork-explained">techtiff.substack.com - Stop Asking Claude What to Do.
