-Industry Integrations - We are making investments in modern API linked integrations across the Advice tech ecosystem: Into CRMs, Back Office, Industry hubs and wider advice tech providers, we will be the most integration platform in the market. All with the aim of making it the best Advice experience int he market 

Key Points:
- Prioritize platform cohesiveness over individual feature innovation to maximize client retention and cross-selling
- Develop proprietary metrics linking platform usage to actual client wealth outcomes, creating competitive moats
- Focus acquisition efforts on clients seeking comprehensive wealth solutions rather than competing on basic investment management



**Q2**: What key resources (technical, human, IP) do you control that competitors don't?

**A2**: Amplifi controls specific technical and human resources that create competitive barriers, particularly given their 501-1000 employee scale which provides operational leverage without enterprise bureaucracy. Their previous transformation experience, while challenging, has likely created institutional knowledge around platform scaling.

Core Competencies Proposals:
- Proprietary Client Data Integration: Technical infrastructure that aggregates and analyzes client investment behavior across multiple touchpoints, enabling superior personalization compared to smaller fintech competitors
- Experienced Transformation Team: Human capital with proven experience navigating agile transformations and organizational restructuring, providing change management expertise crucial for platform evolution
- Regulatory Compliance Infrastructure: Established systems and processes for financial services compliance that newer market entrants lack, reducing time-to-market for new wealth products

Core Differentiation Capability:
- Scale-Optimized Technology Stack: Technical architecture designed for mid-market scale, avoiding both startup limitations and enterprise complexity that constrains larger competitors. With new Microsoft Fabrics, Azure and Dynamics platforms enabled, we are developing a market leading AI powered wealth platform
- Cross-Functional Platform Teams: Human resources structured around platform thinking rather than siloed product development, enabling faster integration of new wealth services

Key Points:
- Leverage existing compliance infrastructure as competitive advantage over agile fintech startups lacking regulatory expertise
- Monetize transformation experience by building change management capabilities into client onboarding processes
- Develop proprietary algorithms using client interaction data that competitors cannot easily replicate
- Directly A/B Test multiple Advice Tech partner models: Market place, Vertical stack, subscription models that support the scaling of the wealth platform over a traditional investment platform. Supporting efficiency, cost optimisation and innovation for our Financial Adviser clients. Also helping their firm owners support cost/ growth multiples



**Q3**: What structural constraints limit your strategic freedom (legacy systems, contracts, regulations)?

**A3**: Amplifi faces structural constraints typical of established financial services firms, but their previous transformation attempts reveal specific limitation patterns. Understanding these constraints is crucial for realistic strategic planning given their ambitious 2028 growth targets.

Core Competencies Proposals:
- Legacy System Integration: Technical debt from previous systems that limits rapid feature deployment, requiring careful architectural planning for new wealth platform components. Decoupling under way through APIs into the core platform, but speed to change and costs of change still impacted, but reducing year over year
- Regulatory Compliance Requirements: Financial services regulations that constrain product innovation speed and require extensive documentation, testing, and approval processes before market launch
- Existing Client Base Expectations: Current client relationships that may resist platform changes, creating tension between innovation needs and customer retention priorities

Core Differentiation Capability:
- Contract Limitations with Current Technology Vendors: Existing partnerships that may restrict ability to implement best-of-breed solutions for specific wealth management functions (e.g. with FNZ platform restrictions, speed of change)
- Organizational Change Fatigue: Employee resistance to transformation initiatives based on previous restructuring experiences, potentially slowing platform adoption internally
- Capital Allocation Constraints: Financial commitments from previous transformation investments that limit resources available for new platform development

Key Points:
- Conduct immediate technical debt assessment to identify which legacy systems must be maintained versus replaced for wealth platform success
- Map regulatory requirements against competitor compliance strategies to identify areas where constraints create defensive advantages
- Develop change management strategy that builds on previous transformation lessons rather than repeating failed approaches



**Q4**: Which capabilities are table stakes vs. truly differentiated in your market?

**A4**: **Updated B2B2C Differentiation for Advice Networks:**

**Table Stakes for Network Platforms:**
- Multi-advisor practice management and oversight dashboards
- Standardized compliance processes across hundreds of advisors
- Centralized investment platform with approved product lists
- White-label client portals maintaining network brand consistency

**Emerging Table Stakes:**
- Real-time network-wide compliance monitoring and risk management
- Standardized advice process workflows that ensure quality consistency
- Automated suitability and documentation across all network advisors
- Centralized reporting for network leadership and regulatory oversight

**True Network Differentiation:**
- **Network Intelligence**: Analytics showing which advisors/processes drive best client outcomes across the entire network, enabling performance optimization
- **Scale Advantage Tools**: Capabilities that make large networks demonstrably better than independent advisors (bulk pricing, specialized expertise, risk pooling)
- **Advisor Development Platform**: Tools that help networks rapidly onboard new advisors and maintain quality standards across diverse skill levels

**Critical Competitive Positioning:**
Your competition is now platforms like Intelliflo, Aviva Platform, or even in-house solutions from networks like Openwork or Intrinsic. You need to prove why a network would switch from their current platform to yours.

**Key strategic question**: What would make a 500+ advisor network choose your platform over their existing solution? Focus on network-level competitive advantages, not individual advisor productivity. My belief is this will be efficiency, speed, investment breadth, integration to enable advisers to work how they want, when they want; then finally a modular integrated advice tech market place which enables a advisers to use the platform as their hub connected to all their tools and across the advice journey. You've identified the real value drivers for large networks - advisor autonomy within a unified ecosystem. This is much more sophisticated than the typical "better investment performance" positioning.

**Strategic validation of your belief:**

**Efficiency at Network Scale**: Large networks lose money when advisors spend time on admin vs. client conversations. Your platform becomes the network's competitive advantage if it measurably increases advisor productivity.

**Advisor Autonomy Within Control**: This is genius - networks want consistency but advisors want flexibility. A modular marketplace where advisors can configure their tech stack while staying within network compliance could solve this fundamental tension.

**Integration Hub Strategy**: Instead of being another tool, you become the command center that orchestrates everything else. This creates massive switching costs once embedded.

**Critical questions to validate this positioning:**

1. **Efficiency metrics**: What specific time savings would make a network switch platforms? Is it 20% more client meetings per advisor? Faster onboarding of new advisors?

2. **Integration reality**: Which tool integrations would be most valuable to advisors but hardest for networks to build themselves?

3. **Marketplace dynamics**: How do you ensure quality control in a modular marketplace while maintaining advisor choice?

**The bigger strategic question**: If you nail this vision, you're essentially becoming the "operating system" for financial advice networks. What would prevent networks from building this capability in-house rather than depending on you?


### Resource Reality [MAPPED]

**Q1**: What is the current composition and skill distribution of your team?

**A1**: Given Amplifi's "lack of clear strategic direction" challenge and their ambitious £3 billion investment target by 2028, your team composition analysis must identify who can execute the comprehensive wealth platform strategy versus who's maintaining legacy operations.

- Establish baseline performance benchmarks before 2028 growth acceleration to measure incremental improvement accurately



**Q2**: Which products are growth drivers vs. legacy offerings?

**A2**: Our customers are advice networks with 500+ advisors. We need to reframe our thinking around what drives growth for large advice networks.

We need to measure network-level adoption and advisor productivity gains: In servicing, cost, value and ultimately multiple.

**B2B2C Growth Driver Framework:**

**Network Growth Drivers** 
- **Advisor Onboarding Velocity**: Products that help networks rapidly deploy new advisors at scale
- **Network Competitive Advantage**: Tools that make their advisors demonstrably better than independent competitors
- **Operational Leverage**: Products that let networks serve more clients per advisor without quality degradation

**Legacy Network Anchors** (what holds networks back):
- Siloed advisor tools that require manual data transfer
- Compliance processes that slow down advice delivery
- Platform rigidity that forces advisors into one-size-fits-all workflows

**Critical B2B2C Growth Metrics:**
- Time from network signing to first advisor live on platform
- Advisor adoption rate within networks (percentage actually using the platform)
- Network retention and expansion (do they add more advisors to your platform?)
- Advisor productivity improvement (more client meetings, faster advice delivery)

**The real strategic question**: Which products make advice networks sticky customers versus which ones they could easily replace with competitors?

Your modular marketplace vision from earlier is exactly the growth driver - but how do you measure and prove that networks achieve operational leverage through your platform versus legacy solutions?

What data would convince a network CEO to migrate 500 advisors to your platform?

**Q3**: What is your current market position and competitive standing?

**A3**: We are competing for advice networks, not individual consumers. We need to focus on our real competition: Aviva, Transact, Quilter, 7IM, Seccl. our real competition is platforms like Intelliflo, Aviva Platform, or FNZ serving large advice networks.

**B2B2C Competitive Reality Check:**

**Real Competitors:**
- **Incumbent Platform Providers**: Intelliflo, FNZ, Aviva - who already serve large networks but with rigid, legacy architectures
- **Network In-House Solutions**: Large consolidators building proprietary platforms (like Quilter's platform strategy)
- **Back-Office + Investment Platform Combinations**: Networks piecing together multiple vendors vs. your integrated approach

**Actual Competitive Battlegrounds:**
- **Integration Speed**: How fast can networks migrate 500+ advisors without business disruption? Especially when often they are a network of smaller firms, in different stages of acquisition with different working practices, investment strategies and advice tech providers
- **Advisor Flexibility**: Your modular marketplace vs. rigid legacy platform constraints
- **Network Economics**: Cost per advisor vs. current solutions, not consumer acquisition costs
- **Compliance Automation**: Network-wide risk management vs. manual oversight processes

**Market Position Questions You Should Be Asking:**
- Which large advice networks are unhappy with current platform providers and why? We actually have a number of panel positions with the top networks (most that we can win), our challenge is converting these to back books moves at scale and speed
- What would make a network switch from Quilter to your platform? Price, Service, Integration, Investment Wrappers. Unfortunately we are behind on service, we need to transform our Digital and Human powered service
- How do networks currently handle the advisor flexibility vs. compliance control tension? It differs from network to network, some want Model B, some fully happy the platform manages it.

**Strategic Positioning Reality**: We're not competing with neobanks for consumers yet (but may come with Monzo./ Revolut?). You're competing to become the preferred platform infrastructure for large advice networks who want to offer their advisors modern tools while maintaining network control.

What intelligence do you have about the pain points networks face with their current platform providers? That's where your competitive strategy should focus.


**Q4**: What gaps exist between your current portfolio and market opportunities?

**A4**: **Critical Intelligence Questions:**
- Do they serve individual advisors or large advice networks/consolidators? We serve large networks, but have won on prices struggling with service and servicie digitisation at scale, hence a new greenfield platform build
- What's the platform architecture - integrated ecosystem or point solutions? BAck end FNZ wealth platform, but modernising with green field. cloud native data, engineering and ai platforms. As well as Microsoft Contact Centre


**Competitive Gap Analysis Framework:**
Once you share their details, we can assess:
- **Network Scalability**: How can we onboard 500+ advisors efficiently?
- **Integration Ecosystem**: How does the tech stack today compare to our modular marketplace vision? The foundations are building but we are in a race to prove it to dissapointed clients
- **Advisor Productivity**: What workflow efficiencies do we offer vs. legacy providers? Industry integrations and soon to launch APIs into Back office workflows, potential to expand deeper across advicetech
- **Network Economics**: Their pricing model vs. value delivered to large networks. We can offer market leading pricing and family price locks to compete on price with most

**What to look for in customer feedback:**
- Complaints about rigidity or lack of flexibility
- Integration challenges with other tools
- Onboarding speed and complexity issues
- Network-level oversight and reporting gaps



## Customer Territory

### Customer Segmentation & Behaviors [MAPPED]
